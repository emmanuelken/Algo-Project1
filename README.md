# Algorithm-Checkpoint1
This repository contains my first checkpoint for Algorithm.
It contains a Script.js file and an Index.html file.
The Algorithm is supposed to read a sentence while counting the length, number of words, and number of vowels in the sentence. 
All the necessary codes were written in the script.js file.
